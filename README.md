<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Quoridor is a 2 or 4-player intuitive strategy game designed by Mirko Marchesi and published by Gigamic Games. You can read more about this game [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor). 
This project has 3 parts: Logic, AI and Learning.

### Logic
This part of Project is a simple multi-player quoridor game. It has 2-players and 4-players mode and you can play it with your friends.

### AI
In this part you are playing with an AI-based opponent. This AI agent uses minimax tree and alpha-beta pruninig algorithms. This part has 2-players and 4-players mode too.

### Learning
In this part AI agents play together to gain experience. In the end, the AI agents which had the best functionality will be the winner of the course. You can see details about thses matches in the log files in Learning folder. This part uses multi-threads to speed op the program.


## Built With

The whole project is built with python. Even for graphic parts of project we used pygame.
* [python](https://www.python.org/)
* [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

   ```
Or if you use windows, download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can get a good understanding of some machine learning concepts like Genetics Algorithm or some AI methos like minimax tree and alpha-beta pruning by reading the source codes.
